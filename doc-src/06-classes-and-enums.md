# Type conversions

## The `k` ("keyword") namespace

For your convenience, NodeAutomation treats standard Apple event types and application-specific classes and enumerators as attributes of the top-level `k` ("keywords") object. Think of `k` as an infinitely large namespace that contains every possible name you could use. Examples:

    // AEM-defined data types:
    k.boolean
    k.UnicodeText
    k.list

    // Application-defined class names:
    k.document
    k.window
    k.disk

    // Application-defined enumerators:
    k.yes
    k.no
    k.ask


Occasionally an application defines a type or enumerator without providing it with a corresponding name name. In these cases, the value will be represented as a raw AE code, e.g. `k.fromTypeCode('#ABCD')`. To construct `Keyword` objects using raw AE codes:

<pre><code>k.fromTypeCode(<var>code</var>)
k.fromEnumCode(<var>code</var>)</code></pre>

Raw codes may be written as four-char strings (printable ASCII characters only) prefixed with a hash character, '#', or as unsigned 32-bit integers, e.g. 0x.

To determine if a variable contains a `Keyword` object:
    
    let v = k.document;
    k.isKeyword(v);
    //--> true

To compare two `Keyword` objects:

    let v = k.documentFile;
    k.documentFile.isEqual(v);
    //--> true


`Keyword` objects are packed as `typeType` or `typeEnumerated` descriptors, depending on how they are defined in the target application's dictionary.


## Common AE types

    AE type             Keyword             JS type
    
    typeBoolean         k.boolean           Boolean
    typeInteger         k.integer           Number
    typeFloat           k.real              Number
    typeUnicodeText     k.UnicodeText       String
    typeLongDateTime    k.date              Date
    typeAlias           k.alias             File
    typeFileURL         k.fileURL           File
    typeType            k.typeClass         Keyword
    typeEnumerated      k.constant          Keyword
    typeAEList          k.list              Array
    typeAERecord        k.record            Object


## Type mapping notes

While AE-JS type conversions generally work quite seamlessly, it is sometimes useful to know some of the details involved, particularly when troubleshooting code that deals with older or buggy applications.


### Undefined

NodeAutomation throws on `undefined`.


### Null

For convenience, NodeAutomation maps Apple events' `missing value` constant to JavaScript's `null` value. This makes it easy to check for missing values using the standard `===` operator.


### Number

JavaScript represents all numbers internally as 64-bit floats. For compatibility NodeAutomation packs non-fractional numbers as SInt32 where possible.


### Strings

Note that while `typeUnicodeText` was formally deprecated in Mac OS X 10.4+ in favour of `typeUTF8Text` and `typeUTF16ExternalRepresentation`, it remains the standard AE text type used by scriptable apps today.


### Filesystem references

All file-related AE types, both current and deprecated, are represented as `File` objects. All file paths are packed and unpacked as `typeFileURL`, coercing as needed; alias and bookmark AE types are not preserved. For example, to open a file named `ReadMe.txt` in the `Documents` folder of user `jsmith`:

    let file = new File('/Users/jsmith/Documents/ReadMe.txt');
    app('TextEdit').open({_:file});

An absolute POSIX path string is required; relative paths and tilde-based paths are not [currently?] accepted.

To convert a `File` object to POSIX path string:

    let file = new File('/Users/jsmith/Documents/ReadMe.txt');
    let path = String(file);
    console.log(path);
    //--> '/Users/jsmith/Documents/ReadMe.txt'

To determine if a variable contains a `File` object:
    
    let v = new File('/Users/jsmith');
    File.isFile(v);
    //--> true

To compare two `File` objects (note: this only checks for exact path string equality):

    let v = new File('/Users/jsmith');
    new File('/Users/jsmith').isEqual(v);
    //--> true

For backwards compatibility with older Carbon apps that only accept (now-deprecated) colon-delimited HFS path strings:

    let file = File.fromHFSPath('Macintosh HD:Users:jsmith:Documents:ReadMe.txt');
    file.toHFSPath();
    //--> 'Macintosh HD:Users:jsmith:Documents:ReadMe.txt'


### Records

The `typeAERecord` AE type is a struct-like data structure containing zero or more properties. NodeAutomation represents AE records as JavaScript objects. The keys in this dict are usually application-defined keywords (e.g. `name`), although they may also be raw four-char codes (indicated by a `#` prefix) or arbitrary strings (indicated by a `$` prefix).

If an object contains a `class` (or `#pcls`) key, appscript will pack the remaining items into an AE record, then coerce it to the type specified by this `class` property. Similarly, when unpacking an record-like AEDesc with a custom type code, appscript will unpack it as a JavaScript object with its AE type described by a `class` entry.


### Unbridged types

Unit types (e.g. `2.54 as inches`) are primarily an native AppleScript language feature and generally not supported or used by scriptable applications. Unsupported by NodeAutomation.

The Apple Event Manager defines many other AE types whose names and codes are defined by NodeAutomation for completeness. A few of these types are of occasional interest to users, the rest can simply be ignored. Unbridged values will be represented as `AEOpaqueDescriptor` objects (equivalent to `«data TYPE…»` objects in AppleScript).
