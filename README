# README

NodeAutomation is a Node.js module that allows 'AppleScriptable' applications 
to be controlled directly from JavaScript.

For example, to get the value of the first paragraph of the topmost document 
in TextEdit:

    app('TextEdit').documents[0].paragraphs[0].get()

This is equivalent to the AppleScript statement:

    tell application "TextEdit" to get paragraph 1 of document 1


Or to create a new "Hello World!" document in TextEdit:

    app('TextEdit').make({new: k.document, 
                          withProperties: {text: "Hello World!"}})

To build HTML documentation, run the following command to install the 
`markdown2` package for Python:

	sudo easy_install markdown2
	
Then `cd` to the `nodeautomation` directory and run:

	./mkdoc


Documentation is preliminary, being a quick and dirty translation of the 
original appscript manual.
